# B-Mode Ultrasound Image Reconstruction

A Python implementation of a simplified **B-mode ultrasound imaging pipeline** that simulates radiofrequency (RF) ultrasound signals and reconstructs grayscale medical images using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.

This project demonstrates the complete imaging workflow from phantom generation to final B-mode visualization using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

---

## Overview

Medical ultrasound systems do not directly produce images. Instead, an ultrasound probe transmits high-frequency acoustic pulses into tissue and records the returning radiofrequency (RF) echoes.

This project simulates that process by:

1. Creating a digital tissue phantom
2. Simulating RF echo signals
3. Applying common ultrasound signal processing techniques
4. Reconstructing a B-mode (brightness mode) ultrasound image

The implementation provides an educational demonstration of how ultrasound imaging systems transform raw RF data into diagnostic grayscale images.

# Signal Processing Stages

## 1. Phantom Generation

A digital phantom represents tissue reflectivity.

The phantom contains:

- Random scatterers
- Bright tissue boundaries
- Circular cyst

Example:

```
-----------------------
Background Tissue

      (Cyst)

-----------------------
Reflector

-----------------------
```

---

## 2. RF Signal Simulation

Each reflector generates an ultrasound echo.

Instead of using simple spikes, the project creates a **5 MHz ultrasound pulse** and convolves it with each scan line.

This more closely models real ultrasound physics.

---

## 3. Depth Attenuation

Ultrasound waves lose energy while traveling through tissue.

The simulation models attenuation using an exponential decay:

```
A(d) = exp(-αd)
```

This causes deeper echoes to appear weaker.

---

## 4. Time Gain Compensation (TGC)

Because deeper echoes become weaker, ultrasound machines amplify signals based on depth.

The project implements Time Gain Compensation to restore deeper echoes before reconstruction.

---

## 5. Butterworth Bandpass Filter

The simulated RF signal contains broadband noise.

A fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter removes unwanted frequencies while preserving the probe's operating bandwidth.

Implemented using:

- scipy.signal.butter()
- scipy.signal.filtfilt()

---

## 6. Envelope Detection

RF signals oscillate rapidly and cannot be displayed directly.

The analytic signal is computed using the Hilbert Transform:

```
Envelope = |Hilbert(RF)|
```

The resulting envelope represents echo strength.

---

## 7. Log Compression

Ultrasound echoes span a very large dynamic range.

Logarithmic compression converts echo amplitudes into decibel values suitable for image display.

```
B = 20 log10(A)
```

The image is clipped to a 60 dB display range.

---

## 8. B-Mode Visualization

The processed envelope is displayed as a grayscale image where:

- Bright pixels represent strong reflections
- Dark pixels represent weak or absent reflections

---

# Technologies Used
